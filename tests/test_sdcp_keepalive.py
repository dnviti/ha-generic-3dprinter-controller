"""The Centauri Carbon's socket, kept the way the printer's own page keeps it.

A user's Centauri Carbon stopped working after a power cycle until its web page had
been opened. Measured on that printer, on firmware V1.4.49:

* a client that sends nothing is closed after 61 seconds, while one that sends the
  text ``ping`` every 30 seconds, as the page does, stays connected;
* the printer pushes its status only when asked, with command 0 or with a ping, so
  a status cached from before the power cycle was reported as current;
* the page switches the camera on with command 386 before it shows it.

The fake printer behaves the same way, with its timings scaled down, and these
tests drive the real adapter against it.
