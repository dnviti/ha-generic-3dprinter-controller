"""One end-to-end test that loads this component inside a real Home Assistant.

The unit tests prove the pure logic and the platform behaviour. This proves the
thing a user actually does, once, against a real ``HomeAssistant`` object: the
config entry is created, the component sets up, the device and its entities
appear, an unsupported command is refused before any frame reaches the printer, a
supported command arrives, and unloading leaves nothing behind.

It is deliberately one test. Home Assistant's shutdown waits on the fake printer's
server-side socket for two minutes, because the fake holds an aiohttp connection
open that Home Assistant cannot force closed. That cost is paid once here rather
than once per assertion, and it is a property of the test double rather than of the
integration: the integration's own teardown closes its session and its adapter in
well under a second, which the unit suite proves directly by driving
``PrinterRuntime.async_stop``.
