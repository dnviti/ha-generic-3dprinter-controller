# Generic 3D Printer Controller

One Home Assistant integration for a **mixed 3D printer fleet**. Each printer is a
config entry, each protocol is an adapter, and everything a user sees reads one
shared model, so the dashboard, the entities and the automations never learn which
protocol a printer speaks.

Covers the **Elegoo Centauri Carbon** (SDCP) and **Centauri Carbon 2** (MQTT),
**Klipper via Moonraker**, **OctoPrint**, **Duet / RepRapFirmware**, and any printer
whose only interface is its own embedded web page. Adding a protocol is one module
plus one registry entry.

Ships its own Lovelace card, `custom:generic-3dprinter-card`: one card that drives
the whole printer, with its camera, its job, its heaters and fans, a joystick for
the head, its stored files, and the smart plug it is powered from.

## Why this exists

A home lab accumulates printers that share nothing. Each vendor invents its own
LAN protocol, its own idea of a print job, its own way to say "72 percent done".
The usual outcome is one integration per protocol, each with its own entities and
its own card, and no single place to see the fleet.

This integration inverts that. Every protocol difference lives behind one adapter
interface, and the capability set is data, so a printer that cannot pause has no
pause button rather than a button that fails when pressed.

## What you get per printer

**Sensors.** Printer state, progress, current and total layer, time remaining,
time elapsed, file name, nozzle / bed / chamber temperature and target, fan duty,
speed and flow factor, and diagnostics for protocol, model, firmware, serial and
address.

**Controls.** Pause, resume, stop and home buttons; target temperatures, speed
factor, flow factor and fan duty as numbers; the chamber light as a switch. Each
one exists only when the printer says it supports it. The card adds a joystick,
temperature presets, and file upload, print and delete on top.

**Camera.** A live MJPEG stream, not a slideshow. The card and Home Assistant's own
camera proxy both read from one shared upstream connection per printer, so a
dashboard tile, the card and a notification do not each open their own. That
sharing is a requirement on hardware whose camera server keeps only a few
connection slots and leaks them.

**The printer's own page.** For a printer with no control API, its embedded page is
reverse-proxied through Home Assistant and its control WebSocket is bridged, so a
dashboard served over HTTPS can embed a printer that only speaks HTTP on the LAN.

## Install

### HACS

1. In Home Assistant, open **HACS**, then the three-dot menu, then **Custom
   repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/dnviti/ha-generic-3dprinter-controller` with category
   **Integration**.
3. Search HACS for **Generic 3D Printer Controller** and install it.
4. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manually

Copy `custom_components/generic_3dprinter` into your Home Assistant
`config/custom_components/` directory and restart.

## Configure a printer

**Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Generic 3D Printer
Controller.**

You can let it look for a printer on the network, or pick the protocol yourself.
Discovery is a convenience, never a guess: a probe that finds something fills in
the form and you still confirm it. Nothing in the config flow sends a command to a
printer.

The Centauri Carbon appears once in the protocol menu, as **Elegoo Centauri
Carbon**, and a second step asks which model it is: the two generations speak
different protocols.

| Protocol | Default port | Credential |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Elegoo Centauri Carbon (SDCP) | 3030, camera 3031 | none on the LAN |
| Elegoo Centauri Carbon 2 (MQTT) | 1883, camera 8080 | access code, if one is set |
| Klipper via Moonraker | 7125 | API key, if Moonraker requires one |
| OctoPrint | 5000 or 80 | API key |
| Duet (RepRapFirmware) | 80 | password, if the board has one |
| Web page only | 80 | username and password, if the page asks |

The camera port for SDCP defaults to 3031 and only needs changing if you moved it.

### Centauri Carbon 2: turn on LAN-only mode first

A Centauri Carbon 2 answers local clients **only in LAN-only mode**. In cloud mode
its broker still accepts a connection, and then nothing ever answers. So, on the
printer's screen:

1. **Settings → Network → LAN Only Mode**, and turn it on.
2. If the printer shows an **access code** there, enter it in the integration.
   With no code set, leave the field empty.

The serial number is read from the printer when you add it, so its field can stay
empty. The config flow checks the mode and refuses a printer in cloud mode with
that instruction, rather than creating an entry that never connects. LAN-only mode
turns off Elegoo's cloud and the remote access of its phone app.

The printer shares a handful of client slots between the slicer, the phone app and
integrations like this one. If it reports that none is free, close one of them.

### The one dangerous setting

On Elegoo SDCP, **starting a print over the network** is off by default and is
asked as an explicit opt-in when you add the printer. Read the reason before you
turn it on.

Elegoo's SDCP start-print command carries a six-field payload that this
integration builds itself. On Centauri Carbon firmware, an unrecognised command
code, or a recognised code sent with an unexpected payload shape, has been
reported to crash the printer's `app` daemon. On that hardware `app` is the whole
host firmware including the motion stack, so a crash destroys a running print and
needs a power cycle at the wall.

Everything else the integration sends is a confirmed-working command, and the
adapter never probes an unknown code. You can enable or disable the opt-in later
in the integration's **Configure** dialog.

The Centauri Carbon 2 has the same opt-in, for a different reason: starting a print
heats and moves a machine nobody is watching. Its firmware also remembers the last
auto-levelling choice, so the integration always asks for levelling, and lets the
printer choose the Canvas tray, because a wrong tray mapping is accepted and then
printed from the first tray. Moving the head and homing are refused unless the
printer reports itself idle.

## The card

The integration registers the card automatically, so there is no Lovelace resource
to add. Put it on a dashboard:

```yaml
type: custom:generic-3dprinter-card
```

```yaml
type: custom:generic-3dprinter-card
entry_id: 01J...            # optional, the first printer otherwise
power_entity: switch.printer_plug
temperature_presets:
  - { name: PLA, hotend: 210, bed: 60 }
  - { name: PETG, hotend: 240, bed: 80 }
jog_steps: [0.1, 1, 10, 50]
```

```yaml
type: custom:generic-3dprinter-card
title: Printers
fleet: true
```

It has a visual editor, so all of this can also be set from the dashboard.

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `entry_id` | Show one specific printer |
| `power_entity` | The switch, light or input boolean the printer is powered from, such as a Shelly plug |
| `show_camera` | `false` hides the camera |
| `temperature_presets` | Buttons that set the nozzle and the bed together; PLA, PETG and ABS by default |
| `jog_steps` | The distances the joystick offers, in millimetres |
| `fleet` | Show every configured printer, compactly |
| `title` | Heading above the card |

With neither `entry_id` nor `fleet`, the card shows the first printer.

One printer gets three tabs:

* **Status**: progress, layers, time remaining and the time it will be done,
  temperatures, fans, and pause, resume and stop. Stop asks first.
* **Controls**: nozzle, bed and chamber targets with nudge buttons, presets and a
  cool-down; fan and speed sliders; a joystick for X and Y with a Z column, homing,
  a step selector and the live position. The arrow keys and Page Up / Page Down
  move the head while the joystick has focus. Motion is disabled while a job runs.
* **Files**: the printer's files, with print and delete where the printer allows
  them, and an upload that can start the print once the file is on the printer.

The header carries the chamber light and, with `power_entity`, a power button.
Switching a printer off always asks first, and says so plainly when it is printing
or its nozzle is still hot, because cutting the power stops the fan that cools it.
A printer that is switched off is shown as off rather than as unreachable, and its
camera is not opened.

The card draws a control only when the printer reports the capability for it, so a
printer that cannot start a print shows no print button, a printer that cannot jog
shows no joystick, and a printer with no camera shows no camera pane.

## Automations

Every reading is a normal entity, so the usual patterns work.

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: Notify when the print finishes
    triggers:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: sensor.centauri_carbon_state
        to: finished
    actions:
      - action: notify.mobile_app_phone
        data:
          message: >-
            {{ state_attr('sensor.centauri_carbon_state', 'friendly_name') }}
            finished {{ states('sensor.centauri_carbon_file') }}
```

```yaml
  - alias: Pause if the chamber gets too hot
    triggers:
      - trigger: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.centauri_carbon_chamber_temperature
        above: 45
    actions:
      - action: button.press
        target:
          entity_id: button.centauri_carbon_pause
```

## Troubleshooting

**The printer is unreachable.** Confirm the address and that Home Assistant can
reach the printer's network. The integration reports the printer as offline rather
than showing stale numbers.

**The camera is black or shows the last frame.** These cameras serve a very small
number of connections. The integration holds one upstream connection and fans it
out, but a second client talking to the printer directly can still take the last
slot. Close the printer's own web page and any slicer watching it.

**Elegoo SDCP will not connect.** The printer allows five simultaneous SDCP
clients. If a slicer and a browser already hold them, the printer refuses the
handshake with HTTP 500 and the integration says so explicitly.

**The Centauri Carbon 2 will not connect.** Check that the printer is in LAN-only
mode (see above): in cloud mode it takes the connection and never answers, and the
integration says so. A refused access code is reported as such. "No free client
slot" means the slicer, the phone app and other clients hold them all.

**Status stops updating while the printer is idle.** On some SDCP firmware the
push scheduler wedges while idle. The adapter requests status explicitly instead of
waiting for a push, so this recovers on the next poll.

**Entity names look generic.** Confirm `translations/en.json` shipped with the
component. Entity names come from there, not from `strings.json`.

## Compatibility

* Klipper, OctoPrint and Duet adapters are built from the documented API surface of
  those protocols. No printer of those kinds was available while this was written,
  so treat them as claims to verify on your hardware. Each adapter's registration
  carries an `evidence` mapping that says what is verified and what is inferred,
  and the integration's diagnostics report it.
* The Elegoo SDCP adapter was developed against a live Centauri Carbon on firmware
  `V1.4.49` and verified end to end.
* The Elegoo **Centauri Carbon 2** adapter was checked against a live printer on
  firmware `02.01.00.00`: status, temperatures, fans, the light, homing, jogging,
  the file list, an upload and the camera all answered as expected. Pause, resume,
  stop and starting a print need a print in progress and were not sent; they follow
  Elegoo's own elegoo-link SDK and community clients measured on the same firmware.
  The speed mode can only be changed during a print: an idle printer refuses it.
  `docs/protocol-elegoo-cc2.md` has every measurement, and `tools/acceptance_cc2.py`
  checks a printer read-only.
