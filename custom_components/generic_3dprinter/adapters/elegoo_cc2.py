"""Elegoo Centauri Carbon 2 adapter: JSON requests over the printer's own MQTT broker.

The Centauri Carbon 2 does not speak SDCP. It runs an MQTT broker on port 1883, and a
client connects to it, registers a client id, and then exchanges JSON requests on
topics built from the printer's serial number:

* ``elegoo/<sn>/api_register`` carries the registration, which is answered on
  ``elegoo/<sn>/<request_id>/register_response``;
* ``elegoo/<sn>/<client_id>/api_request`` carries requests and the heartbeat, which
  are answered on ``elegoo/<sn>/<client_id>/api_response``;
* ``elegoo/<sn>/api_status`` carries status pushes. After the first full status
  they are deltas, and have to be merged into the last full status.

Sources, in order of authority: Elegoo's own elegoo-link SDK (the LAN adapter
ElegooSlicer uses), then two community projects that measured a real printer on
firmware 02.01.00.00. What this project verified on a real printer is recorded in
the registry's evidence mapping.

Three facts shape the adapter more than any other.

* The printer serves local clients only in LAN-only mode. In cloud mode its broker
  still accepts a connection and a subscription, and then nothing answers: not the
  registration, not a request, not a status push. That was measured on a live
  printer. The discovery reply's ``lan_status`` says which mode the printer is in,
  so the failure is named instead of being left as a timeout.
* The printer holds very few client slots, shared with the slicer and the phone
  app, and drops a client whose heartbeat stops. One connection is held per
  printer, and the heartbeat runs for as long as it is open.
* An unknown method is answered with error 1001 instead of crashing the printer,
  which is the Centauri Carbon's failure mode. The hazard model is therefore
  different, but the rule is the same: only methods whose payload has a source are
  sent, and starting a print stays behind an opt-in.

A CANVAS multi-material unit is read with method 2005 and driven with 2001 to load
a slot, 2002 to unload it, 2003 to record its filament and 2004 for auto-refill.
The numbers and payloads are the ones Elegoo's own page sends, as the community
elegoo-web project recorded them.
