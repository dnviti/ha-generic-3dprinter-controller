"""Web-only adapter, for a printer whose only interface is its own web page.

Some printers publish a browser UI and no machine API at all, because the firmware
that serves the page exposes no state endpoint a client can rely on. Such a printer
is still worth an entry: the integration can hand the user the proxied page and a
liveness reading, and the card can say the host is up.

There is nothing else to read and nothing to send. This adapter answers one
question, whether the host answered, and leaves every other reading at its snapshot
default. The one capability such a printer is granted is ``web_ui``.
