"""The base entity every platform shares.

The entity layer is the only place in this integration where a capability
becomes something a user can see or press, so the rule lives here once: an entity
is constructed only when the printer grants what it needs, and the platform's
description table carries that requirement as data. Nothing is created and then
left sitting at ``unavailable`` for the lifetime of the entry.

Every entity reads the same coordinator-owned :class:`PrinterSnapshot`, so a
printer is polled once per interval no matter how many entities it carries.

A multi-material unit is the one thing a capability cannot settle at setup: the
protocol can report one, but whether a unit is attached, and how many slots it
has, is only known once the printer answers. Its entities are therefore added
when the printer first reports them, by :func:`async_follow_filament`.
