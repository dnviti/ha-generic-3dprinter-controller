"""HTTP endpoints that reach a printer through Home Assistant.

Two things are proxied here, and both exist for the same reason: the browser is
often unable to reach the printer itself.

* **The camera.** Frames are read upstream by the integration and re-served from
  the Home Assistant origin, so a dashboard on ``https://`` can show a printer that
  only speaks plain HTTP, with no mixed content and no printer credentials in the
  page.
* **The printer's own web UI.** For a printer that exposes no control API, its
  embedded page is reverse-proxied so it can be embedded in a dashboard at all.

Every request is authorised by an HMAC-signed token carried in a **path segment**.
A browser cannot attach an ``Authorization`` header to an ``<img>``, ``<script>`` or
``<link>`` sub-resource, and the upstream target lives inside the signed payload, so
the proxy cannot be pointed at an arbitrary host and is not an open proxy.

The web proxy carries the upstream **port** as a path segment, because a printer's
page and its control socket are routinely on different ports while the proxy has
one origin::

    /api/generic_3dprinter/{entry_id}/{token}/p{port}/{path}
