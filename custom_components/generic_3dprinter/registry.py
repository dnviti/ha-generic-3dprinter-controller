"""The adapter registry.

Adding a protocol means adding one module under :mod:`adapters` and one entry in
:data:`ADAPTERS`. Nothing else in the integration names a protocol, so the
coordinator, the entity platforms and the Lovelace card need no edit, because all
three read the capability set instead.

Each registration records what is *verified* and what is merely *inferred*, in
its ``evidence`` mapping, and declares any hazard that needs an explicit opt-in.
